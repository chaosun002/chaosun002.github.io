 <i>  <b>简介</b>
 ：In this work, we study a Nash Equilibrium (NE) seeking problem for strongly monotone non-cooperative games with prescribed performance. Unlike general NE seeking algorithms, the proposed prescribed-performance NE seeking laws ensure that the convergence error evolves within a predefined region. Thus, the settling time, convergence rate, and maximum overshoot of the algorithm can be guaranteed. First, we develop a second-order Newton-like algorithm that can guarantee prescribed performance and asymptotically converge to the NE of the game. Then, we develop a first-order gradient-based algorithm. To remove some restrictions on this first-order algorithm, we propose two discontinuous dynamical system-based algorithms using tools from non-smooth analysis and adaptive control. We study the special case in optimization problems. Then, we investigate the robustness of the algorithms. It can be proven that the proposed algorithms can guarantee asymptotic convergence to the Nash equilibrium with prescribed performance in the presence of bounded disturbances. Furthermore, we consider a second-order dynamical system solution. The simulation results verify the effectiveness and efficiency of the algorithms, in terms of their convergence rate and disturbance rejection ability.</p><br>

 <i>  <b>简介</b>
 ：We investigate a distributed time-varying formation control problem for an uncertain Euler–Lagrange system. A time-varying optimization-based approach is proposed. Based on this approach, the robots can achieve the expected formation configuration and meanwhile optimize a global objective function using only neighboring and local information. We consider the time-varying optimization where the objective functions can change in real time. In this case, the consensus-based formation tracking control issues and formation containment tracking control issues in the literature can be solved by the proposed approach. By a penalty-based method, the robots’states asymptotically converge to the estimated optimal solution to an equivalent time-varying optimization problem, whose optimal solution can achieve simultaneous formation and optimization. Furthermore, we consider two more general scenarios: 1) the local objective functions can have non-neighbor’s information and 2) the optimization problems can have inequality constraints.</p>

 <i>  <b>简介</b>
 ：In this work, we study the generalized Nash equilibrium (GNE) seeking problem for monotone generalized noncooperative games with set constraints and shared affine inequality constraints. A novel projected gradient-based regularized penalized dynamical system is proposed to solve this issue. The idea is to use a differentiable penalty function with a time-varying penalty parameter to deal with the inequality constraints. A time-varying regularization term is used to deal with the ill-poseness caused by the monotonicity assumption and the time-varying penalty term. The proposed dynamical system extends the regularized dynamical system in the literature to the projected gradient-based regularized penalized dynamical system, which can be used to solve generalized noncooperative games with set constraints and coupled constraints. Furthermore, we propose a distributed algorithm by using leader-following consensus, where the players have access to neighboring information only. For both cases, the asymptotic convergence to the least-norm variational equilibrium of the game is proven. Numerical examples show the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed algorithms.</p><br>

        A Nonsmooth Generalized Noncooperative Game</a>

 <i>  <b>简介</b>
 ：In this article, we propose centralized and distributed continuous-time penalty methods to find a Nash equilibrium for a generalized noncooperative game with shared inequality and equality constraints and private inequality constraints that depend on the player itself. By using the ℓ1 penalty function, we prove that the equilibrium of a differential inclusion is a normalized Nash equilibrium of the original generalized noncooperative game, and the centralized differential inclusion exponentially converges to the unique normalized Nash equilibrium of a strongly monotone game. Suppose that the players can communicate with their neighboring players only and the communication topology can be represented by a connected undirected graph. Based on a leader-following consensus scheme and singular perturbation techniques, we propose distributed algorithms by using the exact ℓ1 penalty function and the continuously differentiable squared ℓ2 penalty function, respectively. The squared ℓ2 penalty function method works for games with smooth constraints and the exact ℓ1 penalty function works for certain scenarios. The proposed two distributed algorithms converge to an η -neighborhood of the unique normalized Nash equilibrium and an η -neighborhood of an approximated Nash equilibrium, respectively, with η being a positive constant. For each η>0 and each initial condition, there exists an ε∗ such that for each 0<ε<ε∗ , the convergence can be guaranteed where ε is a parameter in the algorithm.</p><br>

 <i>  <b>简介</b>
 ：This article studies distributed optimization algorithms for heterogeneous multiagent systems under an undirected and connected communication graph. Two types of heterogeneities are discussed. First, we consider a class of multiagent systems composed of both continuous-time dynamic agents and discrete-time dynamic agents. The agents coordinate with each other to minimize a global objective function that is the sum of their local convex objective functions. A distributed subgradient method is proposed for each agent in the network. It is proved that driven by the proposed updating law, the agents' position states converge to an optimal solution of the optimization problem, provided that the subgradients of the objective functions are bounded, the step size is not summable but square summable, and the sampling period is bounded by some constant. Second, we consider a class of multiagent systems composed of both first-order dynamic agents and second-order dynamic agents. It is proved that the agents' position states converge to the unique optimal solution if the objective functions are strongly convex, continuously differentiable, and the gradients are globally Lipschitz. Numerical examples are given to verify the conclusions.</p><br>

 <i>  <b>简介</b>
 ：In this paper, we consider robust finite-time connectivity preserving coordination problems for second-order multi-agent systems with limited sensing range. Based on integral sliding mode control and artificial potential field, a distributed controller is developed to achieve robust finite-time consensus and meanwhile maintain the connectivity of the communication network. The method is further extended to address a finite-time formation tracking control problem. Numerical examples are given to show the effectiveness of the proposed methods.</p><br>

 <i>  <b>简介</b>
 ：This paper addresses the controllability of a class of antagonistic multiagent networks with both positive and negative edges. All the agents of the multiagent network run a consensus algorithm using a signed Laplacian. Based on the generalized equitable partition, we propose a graph-theoretic characterization of an upper bound on the controllable subspace. Then, we provide a necessary condition for the controllability of the system and give an algorithm to compute the partition. Furthermore, we prove that for a structurally balanced network, the controllability is equivalent to that of the corresponding all-positive network, if the leaders are chosen from the same vertex set. Several examples are given to illustrate these results.</p><br>

 <i>  <b>简介</b>
 ：This paper considers a class of distributed quadratic optimization problem under an undirected and connected graph. Different from most of the existing distributed optimization works that consider the optimal solutions to be constants, the optimal solution and the objective functions at the optimal solution are both assumed to be time varying. For the case where there is no constraint on the decision variables, gradient-based searching methods are proposed to track the unknown optimal solution. The tracking errors are proven to be asymptotically stable. For the case where there exists a local compact convex constraint set for each agent, projected gradient-based methods are proposed for both neighboring coupled and generally coupled objective functions, and the tracking errors are proven to be uniformly ultimately bounded with arbitrarily small bound.</p><br>

 <i>  <b>简介</b>
 ：In this paper, we study the robust consensus tracking problem for a class of high-order multi-agent systems with unmodelled dynamics and unknown disturbances. A continuous robust state feedback control algorithm is proposed to enable the agents to achieve robust consensus tracking of a desired trajectory. By utilizing Lyapunov analysis methods and an invariance-like theorem, sufficient conditions for semi-global asymptotic consensus tracking are established. A robust output feedback control algorithm is designed to obtain a uniformly ultimately bounded consensus tracking result. Numerical simulations are provided to show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.</p><br>
