<p style="text-align:justify"><b><i>简介：In this work, we study a Nash Equilibrium (NE) seeking problem for strongly monotone non-cooperative games with prescribed performance. Unlike general NE seeking algorithms, the proposed prescribed-performance NE seeking laws ensure that the convergence error evolves within a predefined region. Thus, the settling time, convergence rate, and maximum overshoot of the algorithm can be guaranteed. First, we develop a second-order Newton-like algorithm that can guarantee prescribed performance and asymptotically converge to the NE of the game. Then, we develop a first-order gradient-based algorithm. To remove some restrictions on this first-order algorithm, we propose two discontinuous dynamical system-based algorithms using tools from non-smooth analysis and adaptive control. We study the special case in optimization problems. Then, we investigate the robustness of the algorithms. It can be proven that the proposed algorithms can guarantee asymptotic convergence to the Nash equilibrium with prescribed performance in the presence of bounded disturbances. Furthermore, we consider a second-order dynamical system solution. The simulation results verify the effectiveness and efficiency of the algorithms, in terms of their convergence rate and disturbance rejection ability.</p><br>

 <br>作者 Chao Sun, Zhi Feng, Guoqiang Hu<br><u><i>IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics</i></u>, 52 (7), 5984-5998, 2022<br>
<p style="text-align:justify"><b><i>简介: We investigate a distributed time-varying formation control problem for an uncertain Euler–Lagrange system. A time-varying optimization-based approach is proposed. Based on this approach, the robots can achieve the expected formation configuration and meanwhile optimize a global objective function using only neighboring and local information. We consider the time-varying optimization where the objective functions can change in real time. In this case, the consensus-based formation tracking control issues and formation containment tracking control issues in the literature can be solved by the proposed approach. By a penalty-based method, the robots’ states asymptotically converge to the estimated optimal solution to an equivalent time-varying optimization problem, whose optimal solution can achieve simultaneous formation and optimization. Furthermore, we consider two more general scenarios: 1) the local objective functions can have non-neighbor’s information and 2) the optimization problems can have inequality constraints.</p>

 <br>作者 Chao Sun, Guoqiang Hu<br><u><i>IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics</i></u>, 51 (11), 5532-5545, 2021<br>
<p style="text-align:justify"><b><i>简介：In this work, we study the generalized Nash equilibrium (GNE) seeking problem for monotone generalized noncooperative games with set constraints and shared affine inequality constraints. A novel projected gradient-based regularized penalized dynamical system is proposed to solve this issue. The idea is to use a differentiable penalty function with a time-varying penalty parameter to deal with the inequality constraints. A time-varying regularization term is used to deal with the ill-poseness caused by the monotonicity assumption and the time-varying penalty term. The proposed dynamical system extends the regularized dynamical system in the literature to the projected gradient-based regularized penalized dynamical system, which can be used to solve generalized noncooperative games with set constraints and coupled constraints. Furthermore, we propose a distributed algorithm by using leader-following consensus, where the players have access to neighboring information only. For both cases, the asymptotic convergence to the least-norm variational equilibrium of the game is proven. Numerical examples show the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed algorithms.</p><br>

 <br><u><i>Journal of Financial Services Research</i></u>, 59, 1-45, 2021<br>
<p style="text-align:justify"><b><i>Abstract: </i></b>Banks differ from non-financial firms as they must communicate to both regulators and shareholders. Also, unlike non-financial firms, banks possess opaque and complex balance sheets and are the main providers of credit to the real economy. In this paper, I propose a new index to detect the idiosyncratic uncertainty banks face at the bank-quarter level by applying natural language processing techniques to earnings conference call transcripts. The index reveals which banks at a given quarter signal more uncertainty about their balance sheets. Higher uncertainty is associated with lower lending the next quarter and higher liquidity, suggesting active management of uncertainty. The active management of uncertainty is more pronounced during periods of high aggregate volatility and for banks with more skin-in-the-game. Using loan-level data and firm-fixed effects, I control for demand-side factors and find higher bank-level uncertainty is associated with lower loan issuances the following quarter.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify"><b><i>Abstract: </i></b>Non-US firms have massively borrowed dollars (foreign currency, FX), leading to booms and crises. We show the real effects of capital controls, including benefits, through a firm-debt mechanism. For identification, we exploit a tax on FX-debt inflows in Colombia before the global financial crisis (GFC), and administrative, proprietary datasets, including credit register data and FX-debt inflows. Capital controls substantially reduce FX-debt inflows (larger for more-exposed-FX firms). Moreover, firms with weaker local banking relationships cannot substitute FX-debt with domestic-debt, thereby reducing imports. However, capital controls improve exports during the GFC –by preemptively reducing pre-crisis firm-level debt–, especially for financially-constrained firms.</p><br>
